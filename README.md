This repository contains the ideas and design of 8086 Board Design Project.

Project Description:
 Design a 8086 microprocessor board using Capture CIS and PCB Editor. Draw the schematic
 using Capture, export the necessary files for PCB Editor and design the board. You will be
 required to submit the schematic and the board layouts. Your report should include the block diagram of the whole system, describe the necessary decoding details, describe the chips used in the
 project and their programming details (give example code fragments to setup various chips along
 with their port addresses) and describe the pin-outs of all headers used to connect other devices/
 boards to your microprocessor board. A portion of your grade will depend on the write-up. Your
 write-up should be a technical document, that can be used by others to use your board. Think of
 the write-up as the only documentation customers of your product (microprocessor board) are
 going to get. 
 
 -They should be able to understand your design and should be able to do either of the
 following:
 • Design a similar board using information in your document, or
 • Use your microprocessor board for designing a system. 
 
 -They should be able to understand the
 interface, the specifications and the programming aspects of your board to do this.
 Assume that they have access to the data sheets, so don’t just blindly reproduce information from
 the data sheets. You can point the user to the relevant data sheet for more information that is not
 directly related to your board, e.g. all possible programming modes of the 8279, 8255 etc. Your
 write-up should have a section for each of the major design blocks. Examples would be a section
 for the 8255, one for 8279, one for 8259, a section for the 8086 and it’s associated bus logic, one
 for the decoding section and so on. Remember this is not a two page lab write-up, your report
 should have a cover page with the names of the team members and a table to contents. Include the
 full schematic at the end of the report as a section, reference the schematic as required in your
 write-up and include the Bill of Materials report from the schematic tool. Include the layout, one
 figure per board layer, the drill layer and the silkscreen. The silkscreen should be intuitive so as to
 make the soldering of components easy and important information should be visible to the user
 once the parts have been soldered onto the board.
